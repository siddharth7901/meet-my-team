          creative director
          <p>
            Creative Directors manage the art and graphics of promotional
            products in the fields of advertising and business. Experience
            included on sample resumes of Creative Directors includes rebranding
            a company's color scheme, logo, and brand elements; and designing an
            app user's interface via software like Adobe Illustrator and
            Photoshop. The job of a Creative Director is a stressful one, so
            employers look for several years of experience on a candidate's
            resume, as well as an undergraduate degree in the fields of either
            marketing or graphic design.
