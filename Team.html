            creative director
            <p>
              Creative Directors manage the art and graphics of promotional
              products in the fields of advertising and business. Experience
              included on sample resumes of Creative Directors includes rebranding
              a company's color scheme, logo, and brand elements; and designing an
              app user's interface via software like Adobe Illustrator and
              Photoshop. The job of a Creative Director is a stressful one, so
          employers look for several years of experience on a candidate's
          resume, as well as an undergraduate degree in the fields of either
          marketing or graphic design.
